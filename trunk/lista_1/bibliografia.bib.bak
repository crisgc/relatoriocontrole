  abstract = {An industrial PI controller with dead-time compensation is presented.
	The advantage of the new controller compared with other dead-time
	compensating controllers is that it contains only three adjustable
	parameters; the gain, the integral time, and the dead time. The simple
	parametrization is obtained by calculating the process model needed
	for the dead-time compensation from the controller parameters provided
	by the user. The controller is also suited to processes with varying
	dead times.},
